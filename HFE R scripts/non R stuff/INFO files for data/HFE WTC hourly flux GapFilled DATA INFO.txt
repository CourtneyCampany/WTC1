Chamber flux measurements for HFE-I. The raw 14-minutely data were averaged over an hourly timestep.
All missing data are included (that is, all timesteps are included even if there is no data whatsoever).
Date range is from 2008-4-14 to 2009-3-6.

Gapfilling for H2O and CO2 fluxes was done with SOLO (self-organizing linear output map) (see Abramowitz et al. 2005, 
doi:10.1029/2005GL024419 or original reference Hsu et al. 2002 therein). This is a neural network, a self-fitting
model that predicts the flux as a function of PAR, Tair, VPD and DOY. For both H2O and CO2, the flux per unit leaf 
area was fitted with SOLO (and converted back to the total flux).

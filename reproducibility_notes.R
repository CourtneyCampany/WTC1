###reproducibility notes


###between thesis and pub

#1. I saved the figures and tables in a secondary RMD, maybe easier to convert back from thesis (which are inbedded)
#2. Figure #s in thesis inbedded have been re# with thesis chapter Figure #.#
#3. Likely will need to use pdf figures anyway, but then a list of figure tables is available.

#4. for RMD will use two dummy docx files for thesis and pub, thesis will need to reflect binding requirements.

###comment from MT to address in manuscript

#We found that leaf area was consistently reduced in eCa treatments, 
#likely leading to reductions in both tree C uptake and whole tree C mass of near identical magnitudes (ca. 30 %). 

##True. Someone may ask did leaf level photosynthesis increase under eCO2? 
##A negative effect of eCO2 on tree C uptake and growth is a surprising finding. 
##This seems to warrant further discussion.

DateTime : time-stamp (dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm)
DOY -  Day of year
timecorr - Time correction (minutes); Local time + time correction = local apparent time (solar time).


Air temperature (deg C):
TairRef : Thermistor in ventilated radiation shield (at the demountable)

TairMet : From weather station by the IxF experiment.

Relative humidity (%)
RHdem : Vaisala sensor in ventilated radiation shield (demountable).
RHmet :  From weather station by the IxF experiment.

AirPress - Atmospheric pressure from Licor 7000 (kPa)

VPD - vapor pressure deficit (kPa), using Jones (1992) formula.
VPDdem : VPD calculated with demountable data (RHRot and TaRot)
VPDmet : VPD calculated at the met station (with RH and Tair) (and average Pa when not measured)

Rglob - Licor Pyranometer in weather station by the IxF experiment (W m-2)

Raindem - Raingauge on roof of demountable (mm)
Rainmet - Raingauge at weather station by the IxF experiment (mm)

Winddem - Sensor on mast at demountable (m s-1)
Windmet - Cup anemometer at weather station by the IxF experiment (m s-1)
Winddirection - Wind direction (degrees from N) (weather station).

SoilHeatFlux - Soil heat flux (W m-2), IxF weather station.
